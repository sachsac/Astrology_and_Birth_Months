# Astrology_and_Birth_Months
A look into the prevalence of Astrological Signs and Birth Months using and building upon data from [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/births).

This exercise was a part of my Data Science course at Coding Dojo. This task aimed to build data visualization skills and to re-create or improve data challenges from Makeover Monday. The challenge was to take the birthday data and add an element involving astrological signs to measure the prevalence of each astrological sign for the birth years of 1994-2014 in the United States.

Using both heatmaps and bar graphs to demonstrate the information, I found that Virgos are the most common sign for this timeframe and that Capricorns are the least common. This is indicated by both the heatmap and bar chart.

Regarding birth months, I was able to support information similar to the original article of ["How Common is Your Birthday?"](http://thedailyviz.com/2016/09/17/how-common-is-your-birthday-dailyviz/), which showed that birthdays are much less likely to fall on a major holiday.

Looking strictly at months, February has the least births, which likely correlates given it has fewer days than the rest of the months, as well as August narrowly has the most births, a month that overlaps with Virgos.
